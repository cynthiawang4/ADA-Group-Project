      "['Retired US Army General Wesley Clark called for the internment of persons deemed “disloyal” to the United States government in an interview with MSNBC last Friday. Warning of the threat posed by “lone wolf” attacks similar to last week’s mass shooting in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Clark advocated stepped-up surveillance of US communities and pre-emptive detention of persons suspected of ideological or political opposition to US government policies. “We have got to identify the people who are most likely to be radicalized. We’ve got to cut this off at the beginning,” Clark said. “On a national policy level, we need to look at what self-radicalization means, because we are at war with this group of terrorists,” the former top military commander added. “They do have an ideology. In World War II, if someone supported Nazi Germany at the expense of the United States, we didn’t say that was freedom of speech, we put him in a camp, they were prisoners of war.” He continued: “If these people are radicalized and they don’t support the United States and they are disloyal to the United States, as a matter of principle, fine. It’s their right, and it’s our right and obligation to segregate them from the normal community for the duration of the conflict. “And I think we’re going to have to increasingly get tough on this, not only in the United States, but our allied nations like Britain, Germany and France are going to have to look at their domestic law procedures.” Clark’s recommendations, proclaimed openly on national television, amount to a recipe for mass detention of political opponents of the American state. His assertion of the “right and obligation” of the US government to conduct round-ups and mass internment operations against political opposition, specifically citing as his model the methods employed against ethnic Germans and Japanese during the Second World War, provides a chilling insight into the thinking of powerful sections of the US ruling establishment. Clark’s insistence, moreover, that such measures remain in force “for the duration” of Washington’s temporally and geographically limitless “global war on terrorism” amounts to advocacy of the permanent imprisonment of individuals deemed guilty of no actual crime, but merely being “radicalized” and “disloyal.” These are not the ravings of some television talking head or military crackpot. Coming from a figure of Clark’s pedigree, such comments necessarily reflect views widely discussed within the US state. As supreme commander of NATO, Clark held one of the most senior and politically influential posts in the US military. While serving as Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), Clark oversaw the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, Operation Allied Force, beginning in March 1999. In both the 2004 and 2008 presidential campaigns, Clark was considered among the Democratic Party’s leading contenders. He would likely have gained a senior position in the Obama administration had he not backed Obama’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton after dropping out of the 2008 primary campaign. His role as a high-profile supporter of Hillary Clinton’s latest presidential bid suggests, however, that Clark’s political ambitions have only been placed on hold. Under a Clinton presidency, Clark could well get the chance to implement his proposals for mass “segregation” of dissidents. Preparations for the sort of measures advocated by General Clark are clearly well advanced. In recent weeks, as videos shot in locations from Arizona to New York show, US military units have conducted training exercises, practicing military internment and crowd control techniques at mock internment camps, with military personnel posing as detainees. Clark’s statements, made last Friday on the major cable news outlet MSNBC, have been met with total silence from the corporate-controlled media, failing to receive even a passing reference in the pages of the New York Times, Washington Post, or the Wall Street Journal. This silence in the face of an open call for internment of domestic political opponents, issued by one of the country’s leading political generals, underscores the fact that the entire political and media establishment has decisively broken with centuries-old bourgeois democratic norms. The media silence will no doubt serve to encourage forces within the US military and intelligence apparatus to intensify the drive toward dictatorship. For decades, the military and intelligence bureaucracies have developed the administrative, infrastructural and police components of an embryonic totalitarian state. Congressional hearings in 1987 on the Iran-Contra covert operations conducted by the Reagan administration exposed the existence of a plan developed by the Pentagon, codenamed Rex 84, to detain hundreds of thousands of immigrants and political dissidents and imprison them in militarized prison camps. One Rex 84 sub-component, Operation Cable Splicer, envisioned the replacement of existing bourgeois political institutions by a shadow dictatorship controlled by a select group of some 100 executive branch cadre. In the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, the Bush administration staged a dry run of updated Continuity of Government (COG) plans for a “shadow government, deploying dozens of pre-selected officials to a network of secret command-and-control bunkers across America,” the Washington Post reported in March of 2002. The George W. Bush administration made further preparations for new prison camps in 2006, signing a $400 million contract with KBR to build up the Department of Homeland Security’s “detention and processing capabilities.” The Obama administration has expanded the authoritarian legal and policy framework developed under previous administrations. Since taking office, Obama has issued annual decrees renewing the state of emergency declared by the Bush administration after 9/11 and further entrenching emergency powers granted to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In a series of annual National Defense Authorization Acts, the Obama administration has codified the anti-democratic measures implemented under Bush, asserting unlimited power to indefinitely detain or kill individuals without trial. The preparations for mass detention are part of broader efforts to tighten the grip of the ruling elite over society, using the pretext of an unending “national emergency.” Plans for dictatorial rule have found concrete expression in the imposition of de facto martial law in Boston following the Boston Marathon bombings of 2013 and last year in Ferguson, Missouri following the outbreak of protests against the police murder of Michael Brown. In March of 2012, President Obama issued an executive order, “National Defense Resources Preparedness,” that empowered the DHS to assume dictatorial control over the US economy, including any and all actions considered “necessary to ensure the availability of adequate resources and production capability, including services and critical technology, for national defense requirements.” Last week, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved legislation granting the US government new powers to demand regular reporting from social media platforms about individuals suspected of ties to “terrorist activity.”', 'If a place isn\\'t too far gone to start with, there\\'s reason for hope. That\\'s what we\\'re now seeing in Kansas, with its legislative override of a gubernatorial veto on a law to ensure free and fair elections, following the similar measures in Georgia:According to PJMedia\\'s Bryan Preston: Kansas’ legislature has just overridden its governor’s veto and put into law a set of election reforms similar to those that just weeks ago [in Georgia, that] Joe Biden declared were “Jim Crow on steroids.” Biden would know these laws are nothing like Jim Crow, if he still had all his mental faculties, because he was around for Jim Crow. Biden happily cavorted with segregationist Democrats when it suited him. And Jim Crow was a Democrat policy. The legislation bans ballot-harvesting, prohibits electioneering in voting lines, bans private funds from being used to administer public elections (looking at you, Mark Zuckerberg), and prohibits the local secretary of state or governor from making emergency changes to election laws.Those are all holes in election law that enabled the widespread election fraud in the 2020 election that brought us the odious Joe Biden, a doddering old fool who couldn\\'t even attract a crowd to his rallies, and since taking office has governed like a radical left-wing dictator without the charisma. Georgia has enacted protective measures to ensure the easily done cheating and abuses don\\'t happen again. Now Kansas.What\\'s noteworthy here is that the public support for these measures must be incandescent. A veto override is a big deal because it happens so very rarely. Legislators, obviously, were hearing a lot from voters, and being legislators, they\\'re always looking to save their skin. Polls show that the election law improvements enacted in Georgia were immensely popular with the public, giving their wobbly governor excellent cover to defend them without fear of the left. Odds now are the same in Kansas, which like Georgia, is a historically red state. This isn\\'t about rigging things a different way, by the way, it\\'s about neutrally ensuring free and fair elections, the idea that a voter\\'s vote counts and that their vote can make a difference if they want it to. It actually goes back to the Founding, and the \\'Don\\'t tread on me\\' theme of the Gadsden flag. The law prohibits ballot box stuffing with fake ballots, union thugs showing up at illegal aliens\\' doorways and demanding that whoever answers fill out the ballot their way, or sleazebags slipping into nursing homes with a payoff to one of the staff, in order to fill out the incapacitated elderly people\\'s ballots for them. It also prohibits Pennsylvania-style shenanigans with sudden fiat changes in voting laws that enable leftists controlling the show to \"find\" ballots and not verify them, something the cowardly Supreme Court refused to consider. It doesn\\'t shut out leftists from competing with Republicans, not in the least. It just forces leftists to compete with Republicans on the same terms. That forces them to persuade voters that their ideas are superior, something that takes work, particularly with socialism having such a bad record. They can no longer rig the results with so many kinds of cheating.As former Vice President Mike Pence has noted: Those kinds of measures to ensure free and fair elections actually increase turnout, now that every know that their ballot will be counted and not cancelled out by a fraudulent one.The Kansas measure, coming so closely on the heels of the Georgia measure, signals that something big is in the wind, and it\\'s quite likely more states will follow. Nobody wants to be another California, run by incompetents from only a flabby single party, with wokesters in charge and residents and tax revenue fleeing. This Kansas move shows signs of American renewal and vigor. It\\'s happening -- a wave that will only build.

One patient, however, was badly injured, leading the abortion facility to call for an ambulance to take the woman to Wesley Medical Center. According to pro-life activists present outside the facility, at about 1:20 p.m., an ambulance arrived and left without taking a patient, but then returned a few minutes later as a woman was taken out of Trust Women Wichita on a gurney with a covering over her. The ambulance did not use lights or sirens, which is commonly requested abortion businesses in order to not draw attention to their emergencies. When an ambulance does not use lights and sirens it increases the emergency response time and puts injured patients at higher risk. Pro-life activist and nurse Jennifer McCoy told Operation Rescue that the abortion facility’s security guard, Carl Swinney, threatened to assault another pro-life woman present on Palm Sunday who had been taking pictures of the incident. McCoy has a personal protective order against Swinney, who was convicted of battering her in 2016 when she was praying outside of Trust Women Wichita. READ: Security guard hands pro-lifer a bag of patient’s vomit at Kansas abortion business On April 1, 2020, commissioners in Sedgwick County — where Trust Women Wichita is located — voted 4-1 to limit abortions during the coronavirus pandemic since abortions are non-essential procedures, and a matter of “choice” according to abortion proponents. The vote was largely based on the fact that women were driving from other states to Kansas — including from COVID-19 “hotspot” state Louisiana — amid the pandemic in order to undergo elective abortions despite the recommendation from the government for citizens to halt unnecessary domestic travel. That vote to halt elective abortions in Kansas has not been carried out as of yet as it is now in the hands of chief county health officer Dr. Garold Minns, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, and Governor Laura Kelly. Kelly is an abortion supporter who considers abortion essential and will likely not call for the suspension of abortions. Trust Women Wichita is housed in the same location where abortionist George Tiller committed late-term abortions on viable babies before he was shot and killed outside his church in 2009. “Like” Live Action News on Facebook for more pro-life news and commentary!

El Universal says it will publish 16 pages a day as of Monday, down from its regular 24 pages. It says it can keep that up for two more weeks. Several other papers already have slimmed or shut down, blaming government currency controls. El Universal says it has had paper sitting in a Venezuelan port since January, but needs dollars to release it from bond. It blames government delays in allowing it to exchange the local currency for dollars. The government sells hard currency at low prices, but importers complain it can take months for officials to approve the exchanges, leading to shortages of imports, which result in reduced production for many goods.

Since then, Trump has managed to avoid picking pointless fights with elected Republicans – which has helped him consolidate his relationship with Republicans and close the gap on Hillary Clinton. Welp. The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake. Sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2016 Incredible. Apparently, what set Trump off was that Flake went on Tapper today and did not kiss the Trump pinky ring. Now, what does that matter to Donald Trump? Very little. If he needs Jeff Flake’s help to win Arizona, he is screwed anyway and likely looking at an electoral landslide. If he doesn’t, what does he have to lose by taking the high road? Imagine an alternate universe in which Trump, after winning Indiana, refused to engage any high profile Republicans in a fight. Every time someone like Ted Cruz or Paul Ryan or John McCain or Jeff Flake said something, Trump responded with a smile and a “Sorry he feels that way. I’ll be focused on keeping Crooked Hillary out of the White House and I hope that eventually he joins us in that effort, but if he does not, we plan to do our best to win anyway.” Does anyone have the slightest belief that Trump would be at least tied with Hillary right now, if not leading her? I’ve repeatedly noted that the reason Hillary is winning is because she is carrying 90%+ of Dems while Trump is carrying barely 80% of Republicans. Anyway, if Trump were capable of understanding this point, he wouldn’t be Trump. It’s almost a waste of time to point it out anymore. ']\n",

Jon Brodkin - Apr 4, 2017 6:40 pm UTC Although the move to eliminate Web browsing privacy rules was pushed through Congress by Republican lawmakers over the objections of Democrats, a new poll found that equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats approve of the rules and wanted them to be preserved. President Donald Trump yesterday signed the repeal of online privacy rules that would have limited the ability of ISPs to share or sell customers\\' browsing history for advertising purposes, confirming action taken by the Senate and House. This was very much a partisan issue among elected officials. In a 50-48 vote, every Republican senator voted to kill privacy rules and every Democratic senator voted to preserve them. The House vote was 215-205, with 15 Republicans breaking ranks in order to support the privacy rules. But ordinary Americans aren\\'t split on the issue, according to a Huffington Post/YouGov survey that found 72 percent of Republicans and 72 percent of Democrats opposed the rollback. \"[E]ven identifying the bill as a GOP proposal isn’t enough to win it intra-party support,\" Huffington Post wrote. \"Told that Republicans in Congress passed a bill to overturn the regulations that would ban the sharing of customers’ information, 72 percent of both Republicans and Democrats say the privacy rules should go into effect, with just 15 percent in each party believing the rules should be overturned.\" The rest answered, \"not sure.\" Full results are available here. The poll question asked, \"Last year, the federal government adopted a set of rules to ban telecom and cable companies from sharing customers’ personal information, including their Web browsing history, without their permission. A Republican bill passed by Congress would overturn those rules before they go into effect. Which describes your opinion?\" The question was answered by 362 Democrats and 248 Republicans. Support for privacy rules was even greater in response to an earlier question that did not mention the plan to kill the rules. When asked, \"Do you think telecom and cable companies should or should not be allowed to share personal information about customers, such as their Web browsing history, without first getting customers’ permission?\", 82 percent of Democrats and 84 percent of Republicans said ISPs should not be allowed to share such information without customers\\' prior consent. Eighty percent of survey respondents reported being \"somewhat\" or \"very\" concerned about the privacy of personal information online. But most don\\'t know much about privacy-protecting technologies. When asked if they\\'d ever used anonymous browsing technologies like proxy servers, Tor, or VPNs, 55 percent either were not sure or did not know what those technologies are. Sixty-three percent of Republicans weren\\'t sure or didn\\'t know what those technologies are, compared to 53 percent of Democrats. YouGov polls are conducted differently from traditional telephone surveys. YouGov\\'s panel of people who agreed to participate in online surveys \"is itself not representative of the US population, but samples are drawn from that panel to match a random sample of respondents drawn from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey,\" the survey methodology says. No poll is perfect, but YouGov has gained some recognition. The Economist has partnered with YouGov for years. FiveThirtyEight gives YouGov a \"B\" rating—the site\\'s grades for other polls range from A+ to F. On privacy, the Huffington Post/YouGov poll found large majorities supporting privacy rules regardless of age, gender, race, income, and geographical region, though there were differences within groups. But the people whose opinions really counted were Republican elected officials and ISPs who lobbied to kill the rules. No Democratic lawmakers voted to repeal the privacy rules, even though elected officials from both major parties received plenty of financial donations from telecom companies, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. ISPs tend to spread their cash around to both parties in hopes of gaining favor throughout the government, but Republicans who voted to keep the privacy rules have not been rewarded as richly as Republicans who voted to eliminate them. \"On the House side, while there wasn’t a huge difference in overall funds received by lawmakers voting for or against the resolution, there was a gap in the Republican vote,\" the research group said. \"GOP lawmakers who voted to quash the rule received an average of $138,000 from the industry over the course of their careers. The 15 Republicans voting nay? They got just $77,000.\" A difference of $37,566 to $21,395 was also observed when looking at these numbers for 2016 only. Three House Democrats who abstained from the vote received higher donations than Democrats on average, the analysis found. You must login or create an account to comment.

Ad Choices', 'What the Alt-Right Understands About Winning Elections That Some Progressives Do Not This past week, I received an expected fan note—from the internet’s neo-Nazis. Now, the alt-right is very familiar with my work. In fact, during the 2016 election campaign, an Anti-Defamation League study found that I was the second-most abused Jewish journalist on Twitter by its partisans. Yet on Friday, a clip of my appearance on a recent panel at the American Jewish Committee’s Global Forum was posted and praised by The Daily Stormer, one of white nationalism’s premier outlets. Under the headline, “It’s a Good Thing Most Young Jews Aren’t Anywhere Near as Self-Aware as Yair Rosenberg,” the video received thousands of views. I raise this incident not to drive traffic or attention to The Daily Stormer (which is why I’m not linking to them), but because their reaction offers a warning for those who underestimate America’s white nationalists. On the panel they lauded, I explained a key strategic choice made by the far-right that has enabled them to be more electorally successful than the far-left. Their applause is an admission that should trouble their opponents. Let me explain. The AJC exchange in question took place on a panel about the alt-right featuring The Atlantic‘s McKay Coppins, the Washington Post‘s Jennifer Rubin, and myself. Early on, the moderator asked us to explain how the notoriously anti-Semitic group squares its support for Donald Trump with his pro-Israel posture and Jewish family members. I had actually posed this question to some of my trolls during the election, and relayed the following response: In other words, the far-right succeeded in 2016 because it proved far more politically pragmatic than many on the left. The alt-right is not stupid. It did not think Trump was actually the ideal avatar of its preferred policies. It knew he had connections to Jews. But the group recognized that his candidacy offered their best chance, and so they took it—with relish. Meanwhile, many on the progressive left spent the election campaign—and the months after it to this day—feuding internally over the relative purity of their candidates. A significant number ultimately voted for Jill Stein or not at all. One might mock the alt-right’s Pepe the frog memes, but they were far more electorally effective at rallying the faithful than popular progressive hashtags like #BernieorBust or #JillNotHill. The alt-right knows that their willingness to settle for the real over the ideal gives them an advantage over the left. The Daily Stormer, in its piece on my remarks, admitted as much: “Seriously, we would have a big problem if all young Jewish journalists [read: liberals] were able to reflect like this particular Jew is able to reflect.” The alt-right, in other words, is far more self-aware and pragmatic than many give them credit for—and than many of their opponents are. Until this changes, they will continue to punch above their weight. Previous: Who Are Trump’s Alt-Right Supporters? Yair Rosenberg is a senior writer at Tablet.

That’s good enough for me,\\' \" Boehner wrote in an essay adapted from his book that was published Friday by Politico Magazine. The former speaker called his assertion at the time \"a simple statement of fact,\" but quipped \"you would have thought I’d called Ronald Reagan a communist.\" \"I got all kinds of shit for it—emails, letters, phone calls. It went on for a couple weeks. I knew we would hear from some of the crazies, but I was surprised at just how many there really were,\" Boehner said in the essay. \"All of this crap swirling around was going to make it tough for me to cut any deals with Obama as the new House Speaker.

AP/REX/Shutterstock Update 3 p.m. ET: A federal magistrate ordered Christopher Paul Hasson held in custody for 14 days as the government considers additional charges against him, the Washington Post reports. His public defender classified Wednesday’s filing as a “histrionic mischaracterization of Mr. Hasson.” Original story below. *** The shock begins with the opening line — “The defendant intends to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country” — and does not subside. A detention memo filed in federal court Tuesday in the case of alleged “domestic terrorist” Christopher Paul Hasson paints a chilling portrait of man who describes himself as a “long time White Nationalist” and believes in sparking political change through “focused violence.” As alleged by prosecutors, Hasson was inspired by the manifesto of Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik, and wrote that he wanted to use his own “hate to make a lasting impression on this world” — hopefully sparking “needed turmoil.” See Also 'They Made Me More Dangerous Than Anyone Could Ever Fucking Imagine' Jam Master Jay's Alleged Killer Wants Charges Dismissed or Solo Trial Due to 'Playboy' Article See Also The Everly Brothers: 12 Essential Tracks The 100 Greatest Music Videos Hasson also maintained a long list of what prosecutors interpret as potential targets, ranging from Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough to Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA). According to prosecutors, Hasson’s notations included derogatory nicknames for prominent politicians on his list, including “Sen blumen jew” and “poca warren.” His Internet search history allegedly included queries like: “where do most senators live in dc” and whether senators have secret service protection. Arrested on firearms and drugs charges on February 15th — Hasson is due in district court in Maryland on Thursday afternoon for a detention hearing. Prosecutors argue that public safety demands he remain under police supervision: “He must be detained pending trial.” As described by prosecutors, Hasson is a Lieutenant in the Coast Guard who has worked out of the service’s Washington, D.C., headquarters. He previously served in the Marines and the Army National Guard. Until his arrest, Hasson lived in “a cramped basement apartment in Silver Spring, Maryland.” News reports say he is 49 years old. The detention memo quotes a 2017 email draft, saved by Hasson, in which he fantasizes about causing a pandemic. As quoted by prosecutors, Hasson writes: “I am dreaming of a way to kill almost every last person on the earth. I think a plague would be most successful but how do I acquire the needed/ Spanish flu, botulism, anthrax…” What is the source of Hasson’s anger? Later in the email quoted by prosecutors he writes: “Liberalist/globalist ideology is destroying traditional peoples esp white. No way to counteract without violence.” He appears to be advocating a race war: “Much blood will have to be spilled to get whitey off the couch. For some no amount of blood will be enough. They will die as will the traitors who actively work toward our demise.” In a separate email draft quoted in the detention memo, Hasson describes himself as “a long time White Nationalist, having been a skinhead 30 plus years ago before my time in the military.” In this letter, as quoted by prosecutors, Hasson uses a variant of the N-word to describe the increasing diversity of the American Northwest and declares: “We need a white homeland as Europe seems lost.” According to prosecutors, Hasson drew inspiration from Breivik, the right-wing European terrorist whose 2011 killing spree left 77 Norwegians dead. Prosecutors say Hasson “routinely perused” a manifesto written by Breivik, which they characterize as “a blueprint for future single cell or ‘Lone Wolf’ terrorist operations.” Anders Behring Breivik at the appeal case in Borgarting Court of Appeal at Telemark prison in Skien, Norway, on January 10, 2017. Photo credit: Lise Aaserud/EPA/REX/Shutterstock Lise Aaserud/EPA/REX/Shutterstock In behavior prosecutors describe as “consistent with the Breivik manifesto,” Hasson stockpiled guns and bullets. A search of his residence allegedly turned up 15 firearms and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition. In January of this year, Hasson also compiled a list of prominent liberals that prosecutors call “consistent with the types of people who Breivik identifies as ‘traitors’ and targets for an attack.” The this list includes notations and names that prosecutors believe correspond to: MSNBC hosts Joe Scarborough, Chris Hayes, and Ari Melber CNN personalities Chris Cuomo, Don Lemon, and Van Jones Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Maxine Waters (D-CA) — as well as former member Beto O’Rourke of Texas Also on the alleged target list: John Podesta, the former chair of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, and DSA — or the Democratic Socialists of America. Prosecutors describe Hasson as “a domestic terrorist, bent on committing acts dangerous to human life that are intended to affect governmental conduct.” For the moment they have only charged him with counts they characterize as “the proverbial tip of the iceberg” — including illicit possession of Tramadol, an opioid painkiller, and “possession of a firearm and ammunition by an unlawful user or addict of controlled substances.” Prosecutors believe that drugs were also part of Hasson’s plan of attack. Breivik’s manifesto advises a weeks-long course of steroids be taken in advance of an attack to increase aggressiveness, with the goal of turning the perpetrator into a “superhuman one-man-army.” In the search of Hasson’s apartment, prosecutors say, agents discovered a locked container hiding “over thirty bottles labeled as HGH.” Want more Rolling Stone?

Recently reported information about the Obama administration\\'s release in 2013 of 36,007 criminal illegal aliens does not come from Klein and Elliott\\'s book, which was published last August. That story originated with internal memos from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, or ICE, as cited in a report by the Center for Immigration Studies. However, in \"Impeachable Offenses: The Case to Remove Barack Obama from Office,\" New York Times bestselling authors Klein and Elliott cite further ICE documentation showing the release of thousands more criminal illegals from 2009 to 2011. \"Impeachable Offenses\" further documents that of the more than 7,000 criminals released in those years, some went on to be charged with 19 more murders, three attempted murders and 142 sex crimes after their release from jail by the Obama administration. Advertisement - story continues below The statistics pose a grim outlook for the 36,007 additional criminal illegal aliens reportedly released last year by ICE. The details received more exposure last week after the book\\'s contents were highlighted in a  article linked at the popular Drudge Report. A 2012 House report reviewed the effectiveness of the Secure Communities program, a project initially launched by the Bush administration to build databases identifying illegal aliens who qualify for deportation. The data covered arrests from October 2008 through July 2011. The report, cited by Klein and Elliott in \"Impeachable Offenses,\" analyzed data on 159,286 legal and illegal immigrants arrested by state or local police, including 7,283 illegal aliens who could have been deported but who were not taken into custody by ICE, despite being identified as living in the country unlawfully. Advertisement - story continues below The data shows that along with drunken-driving charges, the released illegals went on to commit 16,226 new crimes, including 19 murders, 142 sex offenses, 1,420 drug crimes, 682 cases of burglary or theft and 48 firearms charges.

Get the latest news delivered daily! E-Edition Trending: Five years ago this month, the Supreme Court struck down a federal law prohibiting corporations and unions from spending money to urge citizens to vote for their preferred candidates on the grounds that it violated those organizations’ First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The case, Citizens United v. FEC, soon became a lightning rod for controversy over the funding of modern political campaigns. Half a decade later, however, it’s clear that many common beliefs about the case are wrong. Citizens United did not rule that “money equals speech” or that “corporations are people,” contrary to the claims of its fiercest opponents. In fact, the phrase “corporate personhood” never appears in the decision. Those who believe Citizens United established this principle evidently slept through the last few centuries, throughout which corporations have been considered “persons” for legal purposes. Importantly, legal persons are not the same thing as human beings, and the court has made it explicitly clear in other cases that the rights of corporations are not equivalent to the rights of human beings. The rights of corporations exist to protect the people that comprise those corporations, and Citizens United is just one in a long line of cases recognizing those rights. After all, what gives corporations such as The New York Times Company the right to report on or endorse political candidates? What gives Simon and Schuster the right to publish books that criticize or praise candidates? What gives Saturday Night Live the right to satirize public officials? The answer, of course, is the First Amendment. It does not matter that the speaker is organized as a corporation or union. As for money and speech, the relationship between the two is not hard to see. Money is a key ingredient in all First Amendment freedoms, especially in modern political campaigns. Just as no one would react to a law limiting how much can be spent building churches or publishing newspapers by saying, “money isn’t religion” or “money isn’t press,” no one should dismiss the free speech implications of regulating campaign finance. The need for campaign finance laws such as the one struck down in Citizens United is overstated because elections cannot be bought. Wealthy self-funding candidates have a history of losing; think of Mark Jacobs, Meg Whitman, or Linda McMahon. In fact, USA Today reported that just 14 of 69 candidates who spent at least $1 million on their own campaigns were victorious in 2010 and 2012. Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor learned the hard way that money alone is not enough to win. He was dispatched in the 2014 primaries by a candidate he outspent 26:1. Unusual? Not as much as you might think. In a 2013 review of the scholarly research on effects of campaign spending, University of Missouri Professor Jeff Milyo found that outspending your opponent has “negligible effects” on competitive House races. The doom-and-gloom predictions that the decision would usher in an unprecedented era of money in politics now seem laughable. The most expensive election in American history was not 2010, 2012, or 2014. As a percentage of GDP, it was 1896 – by a country mile. Unfortunately, because reporting on money in politics rarely takes into account the effects of inflation or the size of the economy, every election is reported as history’s most expensive. In fact, campaign finance remains much more heavily regulated today than throughout most of American history. Prior to the passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act in the 1970s, every presidential campaign in American history occurred under a system with virtually no regulation of campaign finance. Does anyone think that today’s heavily regulated modern politics is “cleaner” than the system that elected FDR, Truman, and Eisenhower? One of the most important First Amendment cases of the last decade is also one of the most misunderstood. When the government argues it can prevent the publication of books or movies containing political advocacy, supporters of free speech can only be on one side. That side won in 2010, and we should remain thankful for that five years later. Bradley A. Smith, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, is chairman of the Center for Competitive Politics in Alexandria, Va. Get the latest news delivered daily!

House Speaker Michael Madigan just introduced a bill to the Illinois General Assembly that appropriates $100 million to build a presidential library and museum “dedicated to the legacy of President Barack Obama.” Illinois is sitting on $7.6 billion in unpaid bills. The state’s credit rating has been downgraded five times since the largest tax hike in state history in 2011. More than 1 million Illinoisans are unemployed or underemployed, ranking the state’s unemployment rate at the third-highest in the nation. The state has signed up more people for food stamps than have been added to payroll jobs since 2011. That out of touch politicians have offered up $100 million in the face of these staggering realities is indicative of the toxic lack of leadership in Illinois. That our elected officials have prioritized the funding of a library – which may or may not even be constructed in Illinois – for a president who is still in office is outrageous. According to the National Archives, presidential libraries are paid for and funded through a variety of sources, including private funds donated to nonprofit organizations. While some presidential libraries have also received construction and development funding from state and/or local governments, that does not mean that Illinois is in the financial position to make such contributions, especially when that money could instead be spent on improving access to health care or put toward paying our bills on time. There is undeniable merit in the history and tradition of erecting libraries to honor our presidents. That being said, let those who support Obama’s tax-and-spend policies pay for his monument. The only legacy his administration has left in the Land of Lincoln is one of debt and decline. Taxpayers can’t afford to fund any more perks for politicians. And $100 million is a price we simply shouldn’t have to pay. Chicago Office | Illinois Policy 300 S.

By DYLAN BYERS 10/22/2012 01:13 PM EDT The 2012 presidential campaign has entered endorsement season as newspapers around the country put their editorial weight behind President Barack Obama or former Gov. Mitt Romney. In this contest, the number of endorsements hardly matters. More telling is how many papers have switched allegiances from four years ago. In that race, Romney has a wide lead: Nine newspapers that endorsed Obama in 2008 have come out in support of the former Massachusetts governor while four that supported Sen. John McCain in 2008 have thrown their support to the president. (PHOTOS: Newspaper endorsements) The Houston Chronicle, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the Nashville Tennessean, Orlando Sentinel, Reno Gazette-Journal, New York Observer, Billings Gazette, The Columbian (Wash.) and the Daily Tribune (Mich.) all supported then-Sen. Obama in 2008 and are supporting Gov. Romney in 2012, according to the Romney campaign. The San Antonio Express-News, Lincoln Journal Star, Winston-Salem Journal and the San Francisco Examiner* supported Sen.

Who no longer blogs about politics. (Via comments here) …Oh, but you are going to love this. I’m going to get a transcript up as soon as I get one, but the short version: Barack Obama is a lying, cheating, no-good, paranoid manipulator who keeps telling you that he’s going to change, but never does. And his friends are just as bad… but you can do something about his friends. Background: John Jordan, a California winery owner and head of the group Americans for Shared Prosperity whose work in outside groups has gained attention in the last year, is planning to air two women-focused spots nationally over the next few days during major news shows like “Meet the Press” on NBC and on Fox News, as well as digitally across national print publications including POLITICO. [snip] …the ads he commissioned from Florida-based ad-maker Rick Wilson feature a woman speaking direct-to-camera about issues like the economy and national security, in a 30-second spot and a 60-second one. She accuses Democrats obliquely of treating women like single-issue voters, and talks about President Barack Obama as if he’s a boyfriend she’s stuck with for a few more years. “The goal here is to communicate with women voters in a way that outside groups and campaigns haven’t,” Jordan said. I know Rick from online: he knows exactly where the boot needs to go in on this topic, and my but didn’t he just? – And the truth of the matter is, it’s all freaking true. The Democrats pretty much do treat every group in their coalition with neither consideration nor respect; and there is in fact a limit to how often you can lie to a person’s face before she starts to realize that she’s being played. Particularly if there’s somebody out there willing to, you know, actually try to present an alternative. Moe Lane (crosspost) PS: How effective is it? Well, Vox reportedly hates it, in much the same way that a classical Central European vampire hates sunlight and whitethorn. So there’s that. I note the Politico article names everyone involved in making these ads. I’m curious if they’ve ever dug so deep into the production of Dem ads… but maybe that’s my paranoia acting up again.

(AP) — Joe Biden scored a thundering victory Saturday in South Carolina’s Democratic primary on the strength of African American support, a decisive win that could force moderate rivals out of the race and blunt the rise of progressive leader Bernie Sanders. Biden’s win came at a perilous moment in his 2020 bid as he needed an emphatic rebound after underwhelming performances this month in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. The race now pivots to the 14 states from Maine to California that vote on Tuesday in what effect will be a national primary. “We are very much alive,” Biden declared at an exuberant post-election rally. “For all of you who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind -- this is your campaign.” Sanders claimed a distant second place, a loss that gave a momentary respite to anxious Democrats who feared that the democratic socialist would finish February with four consecutive top finishes that would make it difficult for anyone to overtake him. The Associated Press declared Biden the winner just after the polls closed in South Carolina. The AP based the call on data from AP VoteCast, a survey of the electorate conducted for the AP by NORC at the University of Chicago. The survey showed a convincing win for Biden. Even with the victory, the shortcomings of Biden’s campaign remain, including a lack of robust funding and organization, and he will face for the first time Mike Bloomberg, a billionaire who has spent more than $500 million advertising in the Super Tuesday states. Bloomberg announced his own plan to deliver a three-minute prime-time address Sunday night on two television networks. He didn’t say how much he paid for the air time, which is unprecedented in recent decades. Biden is barely running any television advertising in Super Tuesday states. And both Sanders and Bloomberg have many more staff and volunteers. But Biden is making an aggressive round of media appearances on Sunday in an effort to counter Bloomberg’s massive spending. He’s also working to secure endorsements from prominent Democrats and, shortly after the Saturday results were in, former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe backed Biden. The South Carolina primary was the first major test of the candidates’ appeal among black voters. That courtship will continue on Sunday when many of the White House hopefuls travel to Selma, Alabama, to participate in ceremonies commemorating civil rights heroism. A number of states that vote on Super Tuesday, including Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia, have substantial black populations. One of the candidates who spent recent weeks wooing black voters, billionaire activist Tom Steyer, ended his campaign on Saturday after a disappointing third place finish. He spent more than $24 million on television advertising in South Carolina -- more than all of his rivals combined -- but never found a clear lane in the crowded contest. Seven candidates remain in the Democrats’ quest to find the strongest possible nominee to take on President Donald Trump in November. They spent Saturday assessing the impact of Biden’s win. Aides to Bloomberg’s campaign said they still believe the former New York mayor can win in a handful of states that vote on Super Tuesday, including Arkansas, Alabama, Oklahoma, Virginia and North Carolina. And Sanders was already looking ahead to the next contests as well, betting he can amass an insurmountable delegate lead. After two consecutive victories and a tie for the lead in Iowa, the 78-year-old Vermont senator’s confidence has surged. Sanders congratulated Biden on his first win and said it was nothing for his own supporters to worry about. “That will not be the only defeat. A lot of states in this country. Nobody wins them all,” he told a cheering crowd in Virginia. “Now we enter Super Tuesday.” Pressure is building on lower performing candidates including former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to justify staying in the race. None gave any indication on Saturday that they would exit before Tuesday. Through four contests, Sanders has a healthy, but shrinking, delegate lead. The AP has allocated at least 54 delegates to Sanders with a few more expected as South Carolina’s remaining votes dribble in. Biden vaulted past Buttigieg into second place with at least 44 delegates and he’s likely to get several more. Buttigieg, Warren and Klobuchar remain stuck at 26, eight and seven, respectively. Trump was paying close attention to the Democratic race. Speaking before conservative activists earlier in the day, the president conducted a poll of sorts by asking his audience to cheer for who would be the best Democratic contender for him to face in November. Sanders was the clear winner. “How could you be easier to beat than Joe? That guy can’t put two sentences together,” Trump told attendees of the Conservative Political Action Conference in suburban Washington. “But you know he is more down the middle. Everyone knows he’s not a communist and with Bernie there a real question about that.” But Saturday was all about Biden and whether he might convince anxious establishment Democrats to rally behind him at last. Elected officials inclined to embrace his moderate politics had been reluctant to support him after bad finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire and a distant second place in Nevada last week. Yet fearing Sanders’ polarizing progressive priorities, they’re still searching for an alternative who’s viewed as a safer bet to defeat Trump in November. Biden won 63% of the votes cast by African Americans. He also did well with older voters, women, moderates and conservatives and regular churchgoers, according to AP VoteCast. Sanders earned the support of 14% of African American voters, while billionaire businessman Tom Steyer won 15%. There was also evidence that Biden’s status as former President Barack Obama’s two-term vice president helped him win over African Americans. VoteCast found that 45% voters in South Carolina wanted to return to the politics of the past, compared to about a third in Iowa and New Hampshire. That includes the 51% of African American voters who said they want a Democratic presidential nominee who would emulate the Obama presidency. Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez cautioned Democrats that it’s still early in their presidential primary. Speaking at a North Carolina Democratic Party fundraising gala, Perez noted that to win the nomination, a Democrat must win 1,991 delegates — and only a fraction of those have been allocated in the party’s first four primaries. “We have a long way to go,” he said. ___ Peoples reported from Washington.

With the first exit polls announced at 8 pm Paris time, the party of French President Emmanuel Macron, President Trump\\'s least favorite European leader, is now projected to have won a decisive majority of the seats in French parliament. Macron Wins French Parliamentary Majority Amid Record Low Turnout | Zero Hedge  Just over a year ago, La République En Marche, the new center-left party founded by now-39-year-old upstart Emmanuel Macron, didn’t even exist. Trying to become the youngest president in French history was one thing; creating an entire party to take over the parliament — giving him the actual power to govern — was another thing entirely. Experts pontificated that in the unlikely event Macron were able to actually win the presidency, once in office he would potentially be severely hampered by the rather radical handicap of representing a party that boasted a tiny minority of seats in parliament and thus no real legislative power. But today, in the second round of a two-tier election system for parliamentarians, En Marche is projected to have won some 361 seats in the 557-seat parliament, meaning Macron has now not only surpassed expectations in his presidential bid but also is now fully in control of the French political landscape. The only damper on that incredible victory is what appears to be a radically depressed voter turnout, with only some 42 percent of eligible voters stepping up to the ballot box. (Indeed, some predictions were for an even higher En Marche win — that those numbers didn’t hit above 400 seats may be reflective of that lower voter turnout.) After a landslide victory on May 7 in the battle for the presidency, Macron set to work ensuring that he would also actually have a mandate to rule. He ramped up a recruiting effort to draw new blood into politics, convincing dozens and dozens of first-time would-be parliamentarians to give politics a chance, attracted former members of other parties, and, in so doing, absolutely crushed the two longtime mainstream parties — the conservative Republicans (who took a projected 126 seats) and the Socialists, who have been thoroughly trounced, dropping from 280 seats to an approximate 46 seats. Meanwhile, the far-right National Front’s parliamentary representation can claim a mere eight seats today. Marine Le Pen, the former presidential candidate and Macron’s onetime rival, won a local seat herself — but on the national stage, she is now barely hanging on to a political life. The FN won 34 percent in the presidential elections, far lower than many suspected it would take, due in part to Le Pen’s shoddy performance in an acrimonious late debate. She promised in her concession speech to lead the opposition. That’s never seemed less likely than today. \"France is back,\" Prime Minister Edouard Philippe crowed on French TV after the first round of parliamentary elections. And the Economist this week ran an image of Macron walking on water. “It\\'s a stunning success. It’s incredible, really. This party was set up in April 2016,” Philippe Le Corre of the Brookings Institution’s Center for the United States and Europe said on Friday, thinking back on the first round of parliamentary voting and in anticipation of the second. “Having been able to recruit hundreds of people from the civil society to run for parliament in a few weeks really is just stunning.” Le Corre is not the only one impressed. “Less than a year ago, this guy was not even in government,” says Jeremy Shapiro of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “He had this crazy idea of running for president, and he blew the doors off the entire French establishment and singlehandedly destroyed the French political structure. He wiped out the Socialist Party. He mortally wounded the Republicans. And he is in a position to become an incredibly powerful French president.” Meanwhile, Macron is also positioning himself as a global player. He stood up to Russia’s Vladimir Putin, calling the Russian news outlets RT and Sputnik news “agencies of influence and propaganda, lying propaganda,” while standing next to Putin at a press conference. He has positioned himself as Trump’s direct opponent on climate change, has made it very clear his allegiances lie with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on international issues, and has cheekily presented France as a viable alternative for scientists and globalists seeking to escape Trump’s America. Now he hopes his party’s sweep into parliament will allow him to enact some of the reforms he ran on, namely changing the French labor laws to encourage flexibility in hiring (and firing) and streamlining and centralizing how unions negotiate. The only problem? Abstention voting. It haunted the presidential election, and Sunday’s voter turnout — while high by American standards — was remarkably low for France. That could prove a problem if his reforms seem too radical to the public that simply didn’t turn out to vote. How did a brand new party field a sprawling group of brand new politicians and sweep the legislative elections? “There is a strong demand for renewal,\" Jerome Fourquet, a polling analyst for the market research firm IFOP, told USA Today last week. To understand what that means in practical terms, meet one of those new parliamentarians, who herself embodies some of the spirit and nimble nouveau thinking of Macron’s movement that has energized the country: Amélie de Montchalin. De Montchalin won 61.22 percent of the vote representing En Marche in Essonne, a region about an hour south of Paris, where her family has farmed for the past century. De Montchalin is just shy of 32 years old, a first-time politician, and she took on — and triumphed over — a field of longtime politicians from mainstream parties. En Marche first put out a call for potential candidates back in late January, de Montchalin told me in an interview Friday afternoon. Potential candidates answered the call to action and were asked to write an application of sorts, explaining why they were qualified and interested. De Montchalin said she received texts from several friends the moment the call went out. She seemed perfect to run, her friends insisted. In her application, she referenced John F. Kennedy — “Ask what you can do” — because she is a Kennedy School alumna, and that motto had been on the wall during the two years she worked on a degree in Boston. De Montchalin is a graduate of both France’s prestigious HEC business school and the Sorbonne as well as Harvard’s Kennedy School. She’s never held public office but has worked for the bank BNP Paribas. While she once considered herself on the center right of the French political spectrum, she was never entirely comfortable; by late fall 2016, she says, she had quickly grown deeply disenchanted with François Fillon, the candidate chosen by the Republican Party. She was drawn to the spirit and energy of Emmanuel Macron’s campaign. (De Montchalin is also a mother of three — a 6-year-old and 3.5-year-old twins — which she says makes her particularly up for challenges.) “I ran because I was feeling aligned with the political platform,” she said, when I asked if she would have run with any other party or any other president. In other words: Her decision to run was all about the mission of en Marche and Macron himself. Macron, she says, privileged skill and added value over loyalty or political experience, which was something she was particularly attracted to. “He wanted a government based on skills and not on political past history,” she says. She elaborates: “For many decades, both ministers and members of parliament were chosen because they were loyal local officials and [often] noisy ones.” De Montchalin explains something else that was a draw: She liked that Macron seemed to embody the very lessons she had learned at Harvard, “which was the method to lead reform from platform to results.” Plus, she adds, “I was following what Macron was doing, which was in my mind humanist, reformist, and European.” Not only did Macron’s ideas, platform, and youthful verve encourage de Montchalin to run — they also apparently encouraged the region to choose her over the others running, including the Socialist candidate Jérôme Guedj, a former spokesperson for Benoît Hamon, the erstwhile Socialist candidate for president who was thoroughly trounced in the first round of the French elections. Guedj himself was a longtime politician. In round one, de Montchalin knocked him out of the running entirely when she took 38.8 percent of the votes. Today her closest opponent had 38.77 percent of the vote to her 61.22 percent. Merci pour la confiance des électeurs de la #circo9106. Nous avons tant à faire. Et 5 ans pour transformer la France #laRepubliqueEnMarche pic.twitter.com/8GWLq1YY88 (The tweet above reads: Thank you! We have so much to do. You can count on my involvement and my energy in service to the transformation of France. Below it says: Thank you for the confidence of the voters in Circo9106 (her region). We have so much to do. 5 years to transform France.) As NPR reported earlier this week, de Montchalin’s experience —- of a novice Macronist easily winning seats challenged by longtime politicians — was repeated across the country. And as the New York Times explained on Saturday, many of the new En Marche candidates are like De Montchalin: extremely well-educated and upper class. It’s most likely that Macron will try to pass a relatively targeted labor reform bill as soon as possible. After all, though members of parliament, like the president, have five-year terms, Macron’s power will be at its highest this week, when everything is ahead of him. His shine right now is unbelievably bright. But there are those who will grumble about how this came about. Voter turnout — while still higher than in America — was at a nationwide low during the first round of French parliamentary elections two weeks ago. Abstention, an issue during the presidential election, played a role here too. As the New York Times reported on Saturday, abstention was so high in the first round that efforts to pursue truly aggressive reform may meet opposition from those who don’t feel the Macron agenda suits them but simply didn’t see a viable alternative and so sat out elections altogether. Today, however, En Marche can justifiably celebrate a radical new chapter in French history. Will you support ’s explanatory journalism? Millions turn to  to understand what’s happening in the news.

Transcript: HARTMANN: Our Supreme Court has now said, “unlimited money in politics.” It seems like a violation of principles of democracy. … Your thoughts on that? CARTER: It violates the essence of what made America a great country in its political system. Now it’s just an oligarchy, with unlimited political bribery being the essence of getting the nominations for president or to elect the president. And the same thing applies to governors and U.S. senators and congress members. So now we’ve just seen a complete subversion of our political system as a payoff to major contributors, who want and expect and sometimes get favors for themselves after the election’s over. … The incumbents, Democrats and Republicans, look upon this unlimited money as a great benefit to themselves. Somebody’s who’s already in Congress has a lot more to sell to an avid contributor than somebody who’s just a challenger. I’ve added Carter’s statement to this list of politicians acknowledging that money controls politics. Please let me know if you have other good examples. (Thanks to Sam Sacks for pointing this out.)

The ranks of the uninsured are growing, and people are already dying from a lack of coverage. Yet Joe Biden says coronavirus has nothing to do with Medicare for All. He’s wrong: its time has come.

As the COVID-19 pandemic escalates in the United States, as uninsured and underinsured Americans begin to contract the virus, and as millions more lose their jobs in the economic shutdown and find themselves thrown off their private health insurance, inquiring minds want to know: Is Joe Biden really still against Medicare for All? “Are you now reconsidering your position when it comes to single-payer health care?” asked MSNBC’s Yasmin Vossoughian yesterday. “Single payer will not solve that at all,” Biden answered. His position has not changed since the Democratic Party presidential primary debate on March 15, when Biden balked at Bernie Sanders’s suggestion that having single-payer health care would reduce the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic. Known as Medicare for All in the United States, a single-payer system would automatically extend to everyone and be free at the point of service. “With all due respect to Medicare for All,” Biden said, “you have a single-payer system in Italy. It doesn’t work there. It has nothing to do with Medicare for All.” That’s not how most Italians characterize the crisis facing their country. Even the Italian center-right claims that “the Italian system is holding up, thanks to its universal nature,” and that it would be foolish “to treat only some, and not others.” “Universal public health care is doubtless the reason why Italy hasn’t collapsed,” wrote two Italian observers in Jacobin, arguing that it explains why “the difficulties we face haven’t yet turned into mass tragedy.” In the two weeks since Biden declared that national health insurance would have no impact, save maybe a negative one, the United States has overtaken Italy and every other country in the world in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases. In cases per capita, New York City is on track to surpass the hardest-hit cities and regions in both Italy and China. And as Sanders and other Medicare for All advocates predicted, the fact that we don’t have single-payer health care is adding new dimensions to the crisis that are unique to our country, and uniquely horrific. On March 12, seventy-eight-year old Ofelia Rousseva grew fatigued and slept for the better part of two days. Visiting her son in Greenfield, Pennsylvania, Rousseva, a renowned choir director from Bulgaria, lacked American health insurance, and she was reluctant to go to the hospital because of the cost. On Thursday, March 19, she died in her son’s home. The official cause of death was acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by COVID-19. Her son, a Lyft and Uber driver who has also tested positive for the novel coronavirus, is unable to hold a funeral for her. On March 13, a seventeen-year-old boy in the Los Angeles area appeared fine. “He was healthy, he was socializing with his friends,” said the mayor of Lancaster, California. The unnamed boy, with no previous health conditions, grew sick over the next few days. On March 18, he was taken to an urgent care clinic. Despite his worsening condition, he was refused treatment and instructed to go to a nearby hospital because he lacked health insurance. On the car ride between facilities, he went into cardiac arrest. The hospital was able to keep him alive for six more hours before he died. The boy tested positive for COVID-19. In the past month, Italy has seen many horrors. But it has not seen horrors like these, because in Italy, nobody is turned away for lack of health insurance, and nobody is hit with a bill they can’t pay as punishment for being sick. Instead of Medicare for All, the United States has a patchwork of public and private health care options. For most people who are over the age of sixty-five and some disabled people, publicly funded Medicare is available. For people who can prove they make under a certain income threshold and meet other requirements, which are often complicated and designed to thin the rolls, publicly funded Medicaid is an option. For the most part, everybody else either gets their insurance through their employer or can purchase it themselves on the Obamacare exchanges. More than 10 percent of people in the United States are uninsured. If you have no money and no job in a state that has work requirements for Medicaid, you have no insurance. If you have a job that doesn’t give insurance, pays you too much for you to qualify for Medicaid, but doesn’t pay you enough to afford health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges, you have no insurance. This amounts to millions of uninsured people already — people who, if they were to contract the coronavirus, as many certainly have and will, might be afraid to seek treatment or be turned away. And there’s another category of uninsured person in the United States that suddenly matters a lot. If you lose your job, and with it, your employer-provided health insurance, you have no insurance. You can pay for an extension of your insurance, called COBRA, but if you lose your job during a national economic shutdown and you can’t find another, then you have no guaranteed source of income, making the already-expensive COBRA likely unaffordable. Our private health insurance system is therefore creating a horrifying new problem: it’s generating millions of new uninsured people in the middle of an economic disruption caused by a public health crisis. These are people who, should they be infected, may be reluctant to seek treatment due to the high cost, or who may be turned away by clinics that are legally allowed to reject the uninsured. Between the United States’ millions of already-uninsured people, millions of newly uninsured people, and millions upon millions more whose insurance imposes prohibitive cost-sharing on them — destined to become especially prohibitive during an economic shutdown when money’s tight across the board — that’s a whole lot of Americans who will be boxed out. Eventually, many of those who hesitate to seek care will end up at the hospital anyway, but by then, it could be too late. There are a host of other ways private health insurance intersects with the current crisis. For example, the prevalence of uninsurance and underinsurance obstructs access to preventative care in the United States, which makes Americans less healthy than people in comparably wealthy nations — which makes our populace more vulnerable to serious expressions of COVID-19. Another problem is that some nonessential employers are still requiring their employees to keep working, and if these workers refuse to show up, they risk being fired. Even if they could go without wages, many workers reasonably calculate that they can’t go without health insurance. This is potentially creating a situation in which the need to retain health insurance is encouraging people to congregate at their employers’ command, fueling the spread of the virus. Joe Biden was wrong when he said that the coronavirus pandemic had “nothing to do with Medicare for All.” The notion is naturally seductive to Biden, who is friendly with the private insurance industry and vigorously opposes Medicare for All, but it’s a lie, and a dangerous one. Many have been beating the drum for single-payer health care for decades, not least among them Bernie Sanders. Prior to the pandemic, the idea was already winning solid majorities in Democratic Party primary exit polls, and has even occasionally won majority support among Republicans. But now that the crisis has hit, its time has genuinely come. Joe Biden would presumably like the government to pay for coronavirus treatment, but his narrow suggestion raises issues. Given that COVID-19 will remain among us after the acute crisis subsides, when will COVID-19 patients be asked to pay again? Will his program cover long-term damage caused by scarring infections? If someone has a medical condition made worse by COVID-19, how far does government payment extend? Furthermore, we need to ask: If a system is not good enough for COVID-19, why is it good enough for cancer? The proliferation of questions like these underscores the superior wisdom of comprehensive single-payer health care. Joe Biden is wrong. Medicare for All is rational, humane, and achievable. We need it before the crisis began, we desperately need it now, and we will need it when the crisis is over. Meagan Day is a staff writer at Jacobin.
